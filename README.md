**Multiple Linear Regression for Car Price Prediction
**This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Multiple Linear Regression using car dataset.ipynb) that demonstrates a multiple linear regression model to predict car selling prices based on various features. The analysis uses a publicly available car dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a used car. By leveraging features such as Year, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, and Owner, the model aims to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:

Source: Customer Churn Dataset

Note: While the Kaggle dataset is named "Customer Churn Dataset", the notebook uses a car data.csv file, implying a car dataset. Please ensure the correct dataset is in the repository.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Car_Name: Name of the car (categorical)

Year: Manufacturing year of the car (numerical)

Selling_Price: Selling price of the car (numerical, target variable)

Present_Price: Showroom price of the car (numerical)

Kms_Driven: Kilometers driven by the car (numerical)

Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG) (categorical)

Seller_Type: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual) (categorical)

Transmission: Transmission type (Manual, Automatic) (categorical)

Owner: Number of previous owners (numerical)

Analysis Steps
The Jupyter Notebook covers the following key steps:

Importing Libraries: Essential libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning tasks are imported.

Loading Dataset: The car data.csv file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checking the number of rows and columns (.shape).

Inspecting column names and data types (.info()).

Checking for missing values (.isnull().sum()).

Analyzing the distribution of categorical data (.value_counts()).

Data Preprocessing:

Encoding Categorical Data: Categorical features (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission) are converted into numerical representations using label encoding (.replace()).

Feature Selection:

Car_Name is dropped as it's not directly used in the regression model.

Selling_Price is identified as the dependent variable (target Y), and the remaining features form the independent variables (X).

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split (80% training, 20% testing, with random_state=2 for reproducibility).

Feature Scaling (Standardization): StandardScaler is applied to the independent variables (X_train and X_test) to normalize their range, which is crucial for linear regression models.

Model Creation and Training:

A LinearRegression model is initialized.

The model is trained using the X_train and Y_train datasets.

Model Evaluation:

Prediction on Training Data: The trained model makes predictions on the X_train set.

R-squared Error for Training Data: The r2_score metric is used to evaluate the model's performance on the training data.

Visualization of Training Data: A scatter plot visualizes the actual prices versus the predicted prices for the training set.

Prediction on Testing Data: The trained model makes predictions on the unseen X_test set.

R-squared Error for Testing Data: The r2_score metric is used to evaluate the model's generalization performance on the test data.It is about 84%.

Visualization of Testing Data: A scatter plot visualizes the actual prices versus the predicted prices for the test set.
